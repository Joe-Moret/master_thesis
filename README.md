### Title: An empirical assessment of the relationship between the cost of equity and realized equity returns.

Abstract: This paper critically reviews the large body of heterogeneous literature on methods of computing the implied cost of capital (ICC) to assess their validity and methods mitigating shortcomings. This paper systematically sorts the different approaches mentioned in the literature, identifies the assumptions underlying the models and evaluates the empirical results and limitations in light of these assumptions. Moreover, I empirically assess the cross-sectional relationship between firm-level characteristics and realized future returns using a model-based ICC.

Keywords: Dividend Discount Model, cost of equity, realized equity returns
